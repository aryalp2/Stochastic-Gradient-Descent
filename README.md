# Stochastic-Gradient-Descent
Imagine we have a very large dataset with millions of data points, which is common in machine learning applications. Running batch gradient descent can be computationally quite costly in such scenarios since we need to reevaluate the whole training dataset each time we take one step towards the global minimum. A popular alternative to the batch gradient descent algorithm is stochastic gradient descent, sometimes also called iterative or online gradient descent. Instead of updating the weights based on the sum of the accumulated errors over all samples.
Although stochastic gradient descent can be considered as an approximation of gradient descent, it typically reaches convergence much faster because of the more frequent weight updates. Since each gradient is calculated based on a single training example, the error surface is noisier than in gradient descent, which can also have the advantage that stochastic gradient descent can escape shallow local minima more readily if we are working with nonlinear cost functions
